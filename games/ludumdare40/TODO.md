The more you have, the worse it is



---

- Kill enemies = exp
- Collect coins = exp
- more exp + better equipment = worse spawning of enemies!

## Weapon upgrade cards
- increase probability of leaving an explosive mine on a killed enemy
- increase probability of explosion on contact
- increase probability of splitting bullet on contact, half-dmg (max 3 times, with an other upgrade card?)
- increase magnet radius
- increase player speed
- increase bullets rate of fire
- increase bullets damage
- increase bullets accuracy
- add one life (base:3, max:6?)
