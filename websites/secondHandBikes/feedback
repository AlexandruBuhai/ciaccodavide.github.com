1.     Done
2.     Now after you resize the page over a certain width the enlarging stops, preserving the searchbox sketched appearence. Searchbox color changed.
3.     is it light enough? (i've also brighten up the login,addbike and register inputs. Now it should be like the sketches)
4.     Space between footer-links increased. Background color is now beige for the footer-links.
5.     I've resized the logo and decreased the white spaces, is it any good like this? I'll wait for more instructions.
6.     It should be your cache (check if the background image is still an svg, it should be a png now...)
7.     Thanks to the limited resizing (fixed with 2.) the image remains way smaller. Should it be even smaller? I could halve the image size and place the description on its side (and if it's long enough let it overflow under the image).
8.     This should be the same problem as in point 6. Let me know if nothing changes!
9.     Is it fixed now?
